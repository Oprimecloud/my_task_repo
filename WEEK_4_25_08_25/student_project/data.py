# Folder & File Structure**

# - Let’s say we want to build a Student Records Project.
# - We will first structure our folder and files like this.

# ```
# student_project/
# │
# ├── data.py        # Handles storing and retrieving student data
# ├── utils.py       # Contains helper functions (e.g., calculations, formatting)
# ├── main.py        # Entry point to run the project

# ```
